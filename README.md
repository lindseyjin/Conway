# Conway
Conway's game of life is a "cellular automaton" invented by John Conway that models evolution of systems and complex life forms.
This game takes the form of a set of mathetmatical rules.

For populated cells:
0-1 neighbours: "die" and become unpopulated, as if by isolation
3+ neighbours: "die" and become unpopulated, as if by overcrowding

Unpopulated cells:
3 neighbours: become populated
