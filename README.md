# Conway
Conway's game of life is a "cellular automaton" invented by John Conway that models evolution of systems and complex life forms.
This game takes the form of a set of mathetmatical rules.

Populated cells with 0-1 neighbours or 4+ neighbours will "die" and become unpopulated, as if by isolation and overcrowding. Unpopulated cells with 3 neighbours become populated.
