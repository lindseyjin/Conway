# Conway
Conway's game of life is a "cellular automaton" invented by John Conway that models evolution of systems and complex life forms.
This game takes the form of a set of mathetmatical rules, as follows:

For a populated cell:
    0-1 neighbours: dies
    4+ neighbours: dies
    2-3 neighbours: survives

For an unpopulated cell:
    3 neighbours: becomes populated
